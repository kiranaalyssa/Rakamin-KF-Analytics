# **Rakamin-KF-Analytics**
This repository contains the final assignment for the **Project-Based Virtual Internship** at Rakamin Academy in collaboration with Kimia Farma as a Big Data Analytics.

## Business Understanding
The company wants to evaluate Kimia Farma's business performance from **2020 to 2023** to understand growth trends, operational efficiency, and areas that need improvement. This project aims to find useful insights from historical data to help the company make better decisions in the future.

## Business Problem
Based on the business problem above, an interactive dashboard is needed to visualize the processed data and help analyze Kimia Farma’s business performance. The problem can be formulated into the following business questions to discover useful insights:
1. Which province branch has the highest number of transactions?
2. Which product gives the highest profit?
3. Which province branch has the highest net sales?
4. Which branch has a high rating but low transactions?
5. How does Kimia Farma’s revenue compare from year to year?
6. What is the total profit distribution by province shown in an Indonesia Geo Map?

## Project Scope
In this final project, the dataset is analyzed using BigQuery Sandbox by using SQL JOIN ON queries to enable working with data stored in different tables within the kimia_farma database. After that, a dashboard is created using Looker Studio, which connects to the data in BigQuery.
In short:
* BigQuery Sandbox – Used for processing and combining data.
* Looker Studio – Used for showing the analysis results in a dashboard.
